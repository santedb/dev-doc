# Security Administration

SanteDB provides a robust security environment. This security environment is maintained either through the web-administration panel, or the santedb administration console \(sdbac\).

### Security Center

The SanteDB security center provides a dashboard of your SanteDB security environment. The dashboard provides several key insights into your SanteDB solution.

### SanteDB Administration Console

The santedb administration console can be used to maintain a remote SanteDB server remotely where internet connectivity may be an issue \(too slow for the user interface to load properly\). The SanteDB administration console tool \(sdbac\) provides an interactive console shell which is capable of fetching logs, uploading applets, etc.
