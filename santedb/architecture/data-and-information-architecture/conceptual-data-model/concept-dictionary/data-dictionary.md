# Data Dictionary

The data dictionary for entities which store the SanteDB concept dictionary are illustrated below.

![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28169%29.png)

### Concept Class

The concept class table stores a complete list of concept classifications.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ConceptClassId  \[1..1\] | UUID | Represents a unique identifier for the concept classification. |
| Name  \[1..1\] | VARCHAR | Represents a human readable name for the concept classification. Example: Class Codes |
| Mnemonic  \[1..1\] | VARCHAR | Represents a system mnemonic for the concept class. The mnemonic does not change even if the human readable Name column does. |

### Concept

The Concept table stores the key data related to a concept. The Concept table represents immutable concept properties that cannot be changed once a concept is created.

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ConceptId  \[1..1\] | UUID | A unique identifier for the concept. |
| IsSystemConcept  \[1..1\] = false | BIT | An indicator which identifies whether the concept is a system concept \(i.e. no further versions can be created, cannot be obsoleted, etc.\). |

### Concept Version

The concept version table is used to store mutable properties of a concept. All edits to a concept’s attributes result in a new version being created in the ConceptVersion table.

The concept set entity is used to represent logical groupings of concepts which are related in some manner. These typically are used to drive validation \(i.e. gender field must be bound to a concept in the gender concept set\) or data-entry fields.
