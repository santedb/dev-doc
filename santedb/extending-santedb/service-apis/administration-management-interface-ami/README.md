# Administration Management Interface \(AMI\)

The Administrative Management Interface is identical in every way to the [Health Data Service Interface ](../health-data-service-interface-hdsi/)with the notable exception that AMI resources are more geared toward administrative management, and each resource may have different keying \(rather than UUID\).

The AMI must be enabled on at least one of the SanteDB servers if running SanteDB on multiple servers. It serves as the discovery point and authentication information point for the entire SanteDB infrastructure.
