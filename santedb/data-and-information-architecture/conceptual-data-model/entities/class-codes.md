# Class Codes

Entities are further classified by their class code and determiner code. The determiner code of an entity is responsible from differentiating a type of an entity \(i.e. antigen, dose number, material type, etc.\) and an instance or series of instances of an entity \(an actual vial of vaccine, a box of syringes, etc.\). Most entities within the SanteDB system are expected to be stored as instances of entities, classes of entities will primarily be restricted to materials whereby a class of antigens \(OPV for example\) will have both instances \(vials of OPV\) and sub-classes of representing dose numbers \(OPV0 â€“ OPV3\). Provides a summary of the entity classes and how they are classified in the data model.
