## Discussion

The `role.info` command is for listing a specific role's information and effective policies. The `-r` parameter is used to specify which role to display information and effective policies from.

## Pre-Conditions / Setup

1. Follow the directions from [Security Administration](../../../../../operations/security-administration/#demo-environment) to quickly setup and start using the [SanteDB Administration & Security Console](../../../../../operations/host-administration/santedb-icdr-admin-console/).
2. A role must be created and have status changed to non-active \(i.e. delete the role\) for testing the `-` flag to show the non-active user.

## Actions/Steps

1. Execute the `role.` command with the `-` parameter specified as '&lt;&gt;'.

```text
role.info -r <existing role name>
```
