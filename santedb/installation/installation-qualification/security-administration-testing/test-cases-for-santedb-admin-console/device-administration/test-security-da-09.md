# TEST: SECURITY-DA-09

## References

* [Device Administration](../../../../../operations/host-administration/santedb-icdr-admin-console/untitled.md)

## Discussion

This is a basic test to demonstrate that the Admin Console commands operate correctly when listing security devices \(including non-active devices\) in the SanteDB instance.

## Pre-Conditions / Setup

Should have the iCDR administrative console open and logged in successfully.

1- Use "**device.list**" command followed by "**-a**"  parameter.

```text
> device.list -a
```

## Expected Behaviour

 1- Should display the list of all security devices \(Including non-active devices\) in the SanteDB instance .
