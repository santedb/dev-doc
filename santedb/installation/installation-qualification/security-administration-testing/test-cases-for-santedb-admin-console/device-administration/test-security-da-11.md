# TEST: SECURITY-DA-11

## References

* [Device Administration](../../../../../operations/host-administration/santedb-icdr-admin-console/untitled.md)

## Discussion

This is a basic test to demonstrate the Admin Console commands operate correctly when adding a new security device with setting the policies to grant the device.

## Pre-Conditions / Setup

Should have the iCDR administrative console open and logged in successfully.

## Actions/Steps

1- Use "**device.add**" command followed by a name you wish to give to the new device \(for instance "Create-Device-SDBAC5"\) followed by  "**-g**" parameter followed by the policy OID you want to grant the device.
