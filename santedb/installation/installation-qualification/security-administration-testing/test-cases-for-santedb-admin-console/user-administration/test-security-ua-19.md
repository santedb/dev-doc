## Discussion

The `user.del` command is for de-activating users \(effectively deleting the user\) and has a single `-u` parameter for specifying username of user to delete. 

## Pre-Conditions / Setup

1. Follow the directions from [Security Administration](../../../../../operations/security-administration/#demo-environment) to quickly setup and start using the [SanteDB Administration & Security Console](../../../../../operations/host-administration/santedb-icdr-admin-console/).
2. A user must be created and have status changed to non-active \(i.e. delete the user\) for testing the `-` flag to show the non-active user.

## Actions/Steps

1. Execute the `user.` command with the `-` parameter specified as '&lt;&gt;'.

```text
user.del -u demoadmin
```

## Expected Behaviour
