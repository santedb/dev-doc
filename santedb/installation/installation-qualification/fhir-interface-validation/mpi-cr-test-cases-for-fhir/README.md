# MPI/CR Test Cases for FHIR

## Summary

These tests are intended to allow for validation of the SanteMPI operating as a national scale client registry within an OpenHIE context. Although FHIR is used as an underlying standard, there are particular behaviors/requirements which are not captured in FHIR or even within IHE technical frameworks.

SanteMPI acts as a custodian of patient master identities, as such it is important to ensure that the FHIR interfaces are properly configured and behave. This test suite is based on the following underlying documents/assets:

* OpenHIE Test Framework for HL7v2 Messages
* IHE Technical Frameworks related to patient management:
  *  [Patient Demographics Query for Mobile](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_PDQm.pdf)
  * [Patient Identity Cross Referencing for Mobile](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_PIXm.pdf)
  * [Patient Master Identity Registry](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_PMIR.pdf)
