# Installation

SanteDB is a powerful platform, and has many configuration options. The configuration procedure for SanteDB will depend on the platform you're installing (iCDR, dCDR, dCG, etc.) and the type of installation (developer, demonstration, etc.)

{% hint style="info" %}
SanteDB is a software solution which stores very sensitive identifiable health information. Production deployments require very rigorous planning and testing. **The default options should never be used in a production environment.**
