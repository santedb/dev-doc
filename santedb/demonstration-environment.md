# Demonstration Environment

The SanteSuite community partner Fyfe Software ([https://fyfesoftware.ca](https://fyfesoftware.ca)) hosts a demonstration environment which can be used to illustrate the use of SanteSuite products. These demonstration servers are open to community members and provide a quick way to start writing extensions with the SDK.

Information about the demonstration servers (and runtime issues) can be sent to [info@fyfesoftware.ca](mailto:info@fyfesoftware.ca) and/or [info@santesuite.com](mailto:info@santesuite.com).

Note that demonstration servers may become unavailable at any time and/or may be wiped/reset at anytime.
