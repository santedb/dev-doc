## References

* [Device Administration](../../../../../../operations/system-administration/host-administration/santedb-icdr-admin-console/untitled.md)

## Discussion

This is a basic test to demonstrate that the Admin Console commands operate correctly when listing security devices (including non-active devices) in the SanteDB instance.

## Pre-Conditions / Setup

Should have the iCDR administrative console open and logged in successfully.

1- Use "**device.list**" command followed by "**-a**"  parameter.

```
> device.list -a
```

## Expected Behaviour

&#x20;1- Should display the list of all security devices (Including non-active devices) in the SanteDB instance .
