# Planning & Preparation Work

A SanteDB deployment is not like installing Microsoft Office, or a video game. SanteDB is responsible for storing very sensitive personal health information (PHI) and the deployment of SanteDB in any role (MPI, MFR, MPR, SHR, etc.) warrants careful planning and consideration.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended that you reach out the SanteSuite community prior to performing a deployment of any SanteSuite product. Our partners can assist with planning and deployment services.
{% endhint %}

This section will guide your through some of the common planning activities that should be undertaken prior to deploying any of the SanteDB solutions/components in your environment. &#x20;
