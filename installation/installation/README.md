# Operationalizing SanteDB

Operationalizing SanteDB (or any SanteDB solution) is not a trivial task, any large scale deployment of the solution requires planning and coordination between stakeholders. Implementers are encouraged to use a formal methodology for enterprise architecture (such as CMMI or TOGAF) to manage the operationalization of the MPI projects.

Because operationalization is specific to the problem domain, local jurisdiction, size requirements, etc. SanteDB provides high level tasks for deployment as a reference guide, and provides operational templates for use by implementers which may be of use.

The overall operationalization of a SanteDB service can be illustrated with 5 major activities.

## Information Gathering

Many implementations don't start with a concrete idea of what the deployment of SanteDB will be achieving beyond "we need X". The information gathering phase of an operationalization project is intended to establish a concrete consensus among stakeholder of **what** the SanteDB CDR will be used for.

See: [information-gathering-and-analysis.md](../installation-1/information-gathering-and-analysis.md "mention")

## Planning

After the vision for your SanteDB deployment project has been established, and relevant stakeholders are on board, it is time to begin the planning phase of the SanteDB/SanteMPI solution. Depending on how the target context's project management office operates, the process may differ.&#x20;

See: [planning-and-preparation-work](planning-and-preparation-work/ "mention")

## Development / Integration

Once the project boundaries and overall planning/architecture work has been performed, the task of customizing SanteDB can commence.&#x20;

See: [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")

## Deployment

The deployment phase of SanteDB involves the installation, configuration, validation and testing of the environment.

See: [deployment](../installation-1/deployment/ "mention") for detailed information about deploying SanteDB software.
