# Installation

SanteDB solutions such as SanteMPI, SanteIMS, and the generic CDR are installed in a similar manner. This section provides resources on the planning, preparation, installation and securing of SanteDB iCDR and dCDR software packages.

## Installation for Development&#x20;

When installing SanteDB in a development environment, we recommend[docker-containers](installation-1/deployment/software-deployment/santedb-server/installation-using-appliances/docker-containers/ "mention")for your iCDR instance and then [installing-the-dcdr-sdk.md](installation-1/deployment/software-deployment/disconnected-gateway/installing-the-dcdr-sdk.md "mention").

You can then clone the start code and follow the [getting-started.md](../developers/extending-santesuite/extending-santedb/applets/getting-started.md "mention") article to start developing SanteDB applications!

## Production Deployments

Installing SanteDB in a production environment is an involved process which is dependent on the nature of the environment (hospital, province, national, etc.) as well as the specific requirements of the project management office involved.&#x20;

The SanteDB has collected a high-level guide to the deployment of the SanteDB services like SanteMPI in our [installation](installation/ "mention") guide.
