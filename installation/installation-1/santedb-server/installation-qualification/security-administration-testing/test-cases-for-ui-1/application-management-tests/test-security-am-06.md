## Discussion

This is a basic test to demonstrate that the UI components appear and operate correctly when assigning a policy to an existing application.

## Pre-Conditions / Setup

1. User must be logged into an account with policies granted for assigning policies to applications.
2. Navigate to **Administration Panel / Security / Applications / List**.

## Actions/Steps

1- Click the **Edit** button.
