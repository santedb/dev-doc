# Applet Structure

There are very few hard requirements regarding the structure of your applet. Your applet root directory is treated as the root of a web-server, so you can use whichever client libraries and tools you like to develop your applet. It really is possible to write a disconnected clinical application using your favorite HTML & JavaScript tools.

There are, however, some benefits to following the SanteDB user interface elements. The applets which are readily available for use are:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Applet</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Dependencies</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.core</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">None</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Core API library. Provides the SanteDB JavaScript API.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.uicore</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.core</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">AngularJS based core UI components (provides controls listed on AngularJS
        page)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.bicore</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.uicore</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">BI core functions for rendering reports generated by the Business Intelligence
        Services layer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.config</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.uicore</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Core configuration screens for the key functions of the SanteDB client.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.admin</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>org.santedb.uicore</p>
        <p>org.santedb.bicore</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">SanteDB administrative panel</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.i18n.en</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">None</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Registers the English Language assets</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td style="text-align:left">None</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Registers the French Language assets</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.i18n.es</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">None</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Registers the Spanish Language assets</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">org.santedb.i18n.sw</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">None</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Registers the Swahili Language asset</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Manifest File

The only required file for an applet is the Manifest.xml file. This file is used by the packager to generate a bundle manifest. The manifest file contains:

* Metadata information such as applet author, version, dependencies, etc.
* Translations / String definitions for any languages your applet displays
* Menu registrations for extending the UI menus
* Error asset registrations which are rendered in-lieu of stock error pages
* View model definitions for instructing the API which attributes should be "deep loaded"
* Locale definitions which inject javascript into the core header for the applet pages based on the user's current locale.
* Data setup instructions which are used to insert special data elements which are \(not synchronized on the server\).
  * Note: This is a legacy function, you should instead use dataset files in the Data/ directory
* Configuration settings which your applet or other plugins use to customize the core engine features.
* Template registrations which indicate templates you can use for constructing / pre-populating objects.

### Key Structures

Certain plugins built into SanteDB will look for particular files to be placed in particular paths. 

| Path | Plugin | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| .ref/ | Compiler | Any folders beginning with a . are ignored. The .ref directory is typically used to store references for code-completion. |
| bi/ | Business Intelligence | The bi definitions folder is scanned by the Business Intelligence service on startup, and BI assets are registered for use \(for reporting, creating FHIR MeasureReports, executing ad-hoc data queries, etc.\) |
| dataset/ | Dataset Installer | The data folder is scanned on startup by the dataset installer and any dataset files present in this folder are installed to the server's database. |
| model/ | View Model | The view models folder contains view model definitions which are used to deep-load data. |
| protocols/ | Clinical Decision Support | The protocols folder is scanned by the clinical decision support engine and provides the master list of protocols to be executed by the CDSS engine. |
| rules/ | Business Rules Engine | The rules folder is scanned by the JavaScript BRE engine. This engine is a server-side \(and client side\) ECMA5 environment. This ensures that business rules are executed in the same way on the server and client. |
| match/ | Matching Engine | The matching engine configuration directory is used to configure the SanteDB matching engine. |
