# SanteDB History

SanteDB is not a new application framework developed in isolation, rather it is an evolution of existing MEDIC products in a more easily customized package.

## Evolution of SanteDB

SanteDB is really an evolution of OpenIZ ([http://openiz.org](http://openiz.org)) which itself was an evolution of the MARC-HI SHR RI. The table below illustrates the relative features of each solution.
