# SanteEMR

SanteEMR is one of the [santesuite-products](../../product-overview/santesuite-products/ "mention"), which provides the underlying base functionality to allow the SanteDB iCDR to operate as an Electronic Medical Record.

The SanteEMR solution provides two different user experiences:

* Administrative Screens: Which are used for maintenance of the EMR related functions, accessed via the **SanteEMR** menu item on the SanteDB administration portal.&#x20;
* Clinic User Environment: Which is an entirely separate user interface provided for tablets, laptops, and other local in-clinic tasks.

This section is concerned with the screens provided by the SanteEMR solution. For general iCDR administration tasks such as registering identity domains, managing users, etc. please consult the [cdr-administration](../../operations/cdr-administration/ "mention")guide.
