The facility information is loaded from the primary data store based on this UUID and used to populate MSH-4 and MSH-5.                                                                                            | UUID                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Birthplace Types                   | A list of valid `ClassConcept` UUIDs which are used to resolve the PID birthplace. In HL7v2 birthplace is a plain string. This string is used to search for `Place` for a concrete birthplace relationship.                                                                     | UUID                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Identifier Replacement             | When set to `AnyInDomain` , any attempt to update a patient identifier will remove the existing identifier for that patient in the domain and replace it with the provided value. This has the effect of only allowing one identifier per identity domain from a single sender. | `AnyInDomain`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Strict Metadata                    | When set to TRUE any metadata in any field sent SanteDB must exactly match (place, organizations, etc.) must be matched exactly using the identifier in the XON rather than names.                                                                                              | `True` (recommended)                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Require Application Authentication | When true, all HL7 messages must be authenticated as Application + Device identity. When false, a Device Identity is used and the Application authentication comes from the `No Auth Secret` is used with MSH-3 to authenticate an application identity.                        | `True` (recommended)                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Strict CX4                         | When true resolution of CX.4 based on MSH values will be disabled and all senders MUST send CX4.1 or CX4.3                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                           |
