# Concept Dictionary Administration

SanteDB maintains a robust concept dictionary which is used for describing elements within the software solution. In SanteDB a concept is any logical concept which describes some attribute in real life. For example, a concept could represent a gender \(male, female, etc.\), a type of relationship \(mother, father, etc.\), a status \(active, complete, etc.\).

For more information about SanteDB's concept dictionary, see the Architecture discussion on the concept dictionary.

You can administer SanteDB's concept dictionary through the graphical portal \(in the Concept Dictionary section\) and the administration console. These portals allow you manage:

* Concept Sets
* Concepts & Names
* Code Systems & Reference Terms
* Concept Relationships & Classes
