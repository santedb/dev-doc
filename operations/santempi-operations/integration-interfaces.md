# Integration Interfaces

When enabled, the SanteMPI plugins provide additional interface behaviours on top of the underlying [SanteDB iCDR Integration Interfaces](integration-interfaces.md). Notably, the implemented profiles support the following profiles:

* Integrating the Health Enterprise \(IHE\) Patient Master Identity Registry \(PMIR\)
* IHE Patient Identity Cross Referencing and Patient Demographics Query \(PIX and PDQ\)
* IHE Patient Identity Cross Referencing and Patient Demographics Query for Mobile \(PIXm and PDQm\)

There are several behavioural modifications which relate to the SanteDB governance models implemented which are on-top of those specified in the IHE profiles.
