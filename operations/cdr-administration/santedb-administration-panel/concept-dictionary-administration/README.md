# Concept Dictionary Administration

{% hint style="info" %}
This page documents a SanteDB v3.0 feature
{% endhint %}

The [SanteDB Concept Dictionary](../../../../santedb/data-and-information-architecture/conceptual-data-model/concept-dictionary/) is vital to the operation of the SanteDB CDR solution. The concept dictionary is used for codification of clinical, and non-clinic ideas in the SanteDB database.&#x20;

Administrators can administer the SanteDB concept dictionary from the **Concept Dictionary** administration area of the administration panel.

The concept dictionary administration panel allows administrators to edit:

* Code Systems: Including the reference terms, mappings to concepts, import of concepts, etc.
* Concept Set: Include composing, directly adding concepts to sets, uploading imports, etc.
* Concepts: For granular editing of individual concepts found within the SanteDB concept dictionary
