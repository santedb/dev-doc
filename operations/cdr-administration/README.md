# CDR Administration

In addition to the underlying server operating system and hosting environment, the SanteDB application software also requires routine administration. This section details these procedures and provides reference documentation for the administration of the software application.

There are two ways to administer a SanteDB iCDR server:

* The Administration Panel User Interface: Ideal deployments which have installed and configured the SanteDB iCDR Administration Panel. This tool provides a web-based user interface for administration of the server.
* The SanteDB Administration Console (`sdbac`) : Ideal for deployments with slow internet connections, or advanced users who prefer a console experience for administration.
