# SanteMPI Power Search

The SanteMPI power search allows power users to perform in-depth searches of the SanteMPI's underlying CDR using the [hdsi-query-syntax.md](../../developers/service-apis/hl7-fhir/hdsi-query-syntax.md "mention"). This allows data administrators to find specific records based on any criteria which is stored in the SanteMPI database.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some SanteMPI servers impose minimum search criteria and/or restricted search criteria on their databases. Depending on the data privacy configuration of the deployed software and the user's access level, certain fields may be restricted.
